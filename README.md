# leetcodePractice using C#
### by Han 2020
When I first practiced LeetCode, I deeply felt that my coding-related foundation was really bad, and the algorithm, data structure, etc. had to be strengthened.
When solving problems, I often think about it for a long time and I have to refer to other people’s writing to pass the test, but often I use a lot of trial and error Trail & Error to piece together the correct answer.
I don’t have a precise idea of how to solve the problem. This document mainly organizes my own problem-solving direction and some experience in the process of solving the problem.
